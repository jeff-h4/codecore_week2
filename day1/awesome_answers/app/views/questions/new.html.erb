<h1>create a Question</h1>
<%# The form_for helper method can take an ActiveRecord object as a first arument %>
<%# for instance, @question, which is of class Question. %>
<%# Rails, by convention, will do the following: %>
<%# 1. If @question is not persisted in the database, it will make the action for %>
<%# the form 'questions_path'. it will look for the class name of the passed %>
<%# object (in this case its Question) and by convention submit to questions_path %>

<%= form_for @question do |f| %>
  <%# If you don't mass any option for f.submit it will: %>
  <%# 1. If @question is not persisted it will make the button label "Create [Object Class]" %>
  <%# 2. If @question is persisted it will make the button label "Update [Object Class]" %>
  <% f.submit %>
<% end %>
