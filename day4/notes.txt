CRUD
============================================

bin/rails g crontorller questions
# Rails Convention is to pluralize the controller when it accesses
# a resource (i.e a model)

We add the new method to display a form to add new questions

Add a route
Create new.html.erb: Name it 'create a question'

Add nav link in applications.html.erb
Syntax in route " as: :new_question" means the corresponding path is new_question_path

Create Post path for creating questions


Control flow
1. On homepage, Client requests New question
2. Router routes question/new to Questions Controller, new() method
3. new() method creates instance var @question to store object
4. No render is specified in new() method, so by default, rails looks for views/questions/new.html.erb
5. Form from new.html.erb is generated, user fills in info and submits
 NOTE: Form for @question -> rails will look for questions_path
6. Submit action sends GET action to go to new.html.erb HTML page
questions_path (/question/) and execute Questions create() method

...
Submit button -> go to questions_path (/questions). Route maps to Questions controller, create method
